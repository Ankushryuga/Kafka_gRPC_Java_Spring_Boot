## Core concepts of Kafka:

# 1. Topics:
      => 
      A stream of messages belonging to a particular category is called a topic, data is stored in topics. Topics are split into partitions. For each topic, 
      kafka keeps a mini-mum of one partition. Each such partitions contains messages in an immutable ordered sequence. A partition is implemented as a set of segment files of equal sizes.


# 2. Partition:
      =>
      Topic may have many partitions, so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data.

# 3. Partition Offset:
      =>
      Each partitioned message has a unique sequence id called as "offset"

# 4. Replicas of partition:
      => 
      Replicas are nothing but "backups" of a partition. Replicas are never read or write data. They are used to prevent data loss.

# 5. Brokers:
      => 
      -  Brokers are simple system responsible for maintaining the pub-lished data. Each broker may have zero or more partitions per topic. Assume, if there are N partitions in a topic
         and N number of brokers, each broker will have one partition.
      - If there are N partitions in a topic and more than N brokers (n+m), the first N broker will have one partition and the next M broker will not have any partition for that particular topic.
      - If there are N partitions in a topic and less than N brokers (n-m), each broker will have one or more partition sharing among them

# 6. Kafka Cluster:
      =>
      Kafka having more than one broker are called as kafka cluster. A kafka cluster can be expanded without downtime, these clusters are used to manage the persistence and replication of message data.

# 7. Producers:
    =>
    Producers are the publisher of messages to one or more kafka topics. Producers send data to kafka brokers. Every time a producer pub-lishes a message to a broker, the broker simply appends
    the message to the last segment file.
    Actually, the message will be appended to a partition. Producer can also send messages to a partition, Producer can also send messages to a partition of their choice.

# 8. Consumers:
    =>
    Consumers read data from brokers. Consumers subscribes to one or more topics and consume published messages by pulling data from the brokers.

# 9. Leader:
    => Leader is the node responsible for all reads and writes for the given partition. Every partition has one server acting as a leader.

# 10. Follower:
    => Node which follows leader instructions are called as follower, if the leader fails, one of the follower will automatically become the new leader.





## Kafka Works - Core Flow
  
      [Producer] ─▶ [Kafka Topic (Partitioned)] ─▶ [Consumer Group(s)]


| Component                | Role                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Producer**             | Publishes messages to topics                                                   |
| **Topic**                | Logical feed name where messages are stored (divided into partitions)          |
| **Partition**            | Kafka breaks each topic into multiple parts for parallelism                    |
| **Broker**               | Kafka server that stores and serves data                                       |
| **Consumer**             | Subscribes to topics and reads messages                                        |
| **Consumer Group**       | Group of consumers that share topic load                                       |
| **Offset**               | Position of a message in a partition                                           |
| **Zookeeper** (optional) | Manages metadata and leader election (now replaced by **KRaft** in Kafka 3.x+) |
