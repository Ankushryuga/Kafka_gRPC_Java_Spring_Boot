## Kafka is free and open tool used for streaming events, it helps us build real-time data pipeline and streaming apps.

## Messaging Systems: Its responsible for transferring data from one application to another, so that applications can focus on data, but not to worry about how to share it.

## Kafka vs Traditional Messaging Systems:
    =>
    1. Architecture: 
        Kafka: Its a distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant.
        Messaging System:  Centralized and often limited scalability.

    2. Message Retention:
        Kafka: Retains messages for configurable durations, allowing reprocessing.
        Messaging System: Typically deletes messages after consumption.

    3. Data Model:
        kafka: Publish/subscribe model with topics and partitions.
        Messaging System: Point-to-point or publish/subscribe, but less flexible.

    4. Fault Tolerance:
        Kafka: Replication across brokers for data durability.
        Messaging System: Limited fault tolerance; often reliant on single servers.

    5. Use cases:
        kafka: Real-time analytics, log aggregation, stream processing.
        Messaging System: Task queues, request/reply messaging.

    6. Performance:
        Kafka: Optimized for large-scale data streams
        Messaging System: Performance can degrade under heavy load.
        

## Kafka Main Concepts:
    =>
      1. Apache Kafka Proficiency: Experties in managing and configuring kafka clusters.
      2. Kafka Ecosystem knowledge: Kafka Streams, Kafka connect & KSQL
      3. Data Serialization: Avro, JSON and protobuf formats.
      4. Distributed System understanding: concepts of scalability and fault tolerance.
      5. Microservice architecture: Experience in asynchronous communication with kafka.
      6. Event-Driven Architecture: Understanding of event sourcing and CQRS Patterns.
      7. Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Kafka Manager.
      8. Cloud Tech: AWS
      9. Database integration: Ability to integrate kafka with various databases.
