## Kafka is free and open tool used for streaming events, it helps us build real-time data pipeline and streaming apps.

## Kafka vs Traditional Messaging Systems:
    =>
    1. Architecture: 
        Kafka: Its a distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant.
        Messaging System:  Centralized and often limited scalability.

    2. Message Retention:
        Kafka: Retains messages for configurable durations, allowing reprocessing.
        Messaging System: Typically deletes messages after consumption.

    3. Data Model:
        kafka: Publish/subscribe model with topics and partitions.
        Messaging System: Point-to-point or publish/subscribe, but less flexible.

    4. Fault Tolerance:
        Kafka: Replication across brokers for data durability.
        Messaging System: Limited fault tolerance; often reliant on single servers.

    5. Use cases:
        kafka: Real-time analytics, log aggregation, stream processing.
        Messaging System: Task queues, request/reply messaging.

    6. Performance:
        Kafka: Optimized for large-scale data streams
        Messaging System: Performance can degrade under heavy load.
