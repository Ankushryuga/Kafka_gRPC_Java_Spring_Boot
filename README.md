# Kafka_gRPC_Java_Spring_Boot
Real life practcile for Kafka+gRPC + with Java Spring Boot and ReactJs.


# 🧠 Phase 1: Fundamentals of Kafka
✅ What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform. It's used to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real-time.

✅ Core Concepts:
Concept	Description
Producer	Sends (publishes) data to Kafka topics
Consumer	Reads data from Kafka topics
Topic	A category/feed to which records are sent
Broker	A Kafka server; multiple brokers = Kafka cluster
Zookeeper	Used for Kafka cluster coordination (replaced by KRaft in new versions)
Partition	Topics are split into partitions for parallelism and scalability
Offset	Each message in a partition has a unique ID called an offset

# 🧪 Phase 2: Kafka Setup for Development
We’ll use Docker to spin up Kafka locally (Kafka + Zookeeper or KRaft).

🔧 Kafka + Zookeeper (Basic Setup)
I'll provide you with a docker-compose.yml file to start Kafka locally.

# 🛠️ Phase 3: Spring Boot Kafka Project (Basic)
We'll build two services:

ProducerService — sends user data to Kafka

ConsumerService — listens and processes incoming user data

Includes:

Kafka dependencies (spring-kafka)

JSON message serialization/deserialization

Basic configuration (KafkaTemplate, @KafkaListener)

Logging and validation

# 🔁 Phase 4: Intermediate Patterns
We'll explore:

Custom serializers/deserializers

Error handling with ErrorHandler

Retry logic

Consumer groups and partitions

Manual offset commits

# 🧩 Phase 5: Advanced Kafka with Spring Boot
Topics:

Kafka Streams for real-time data processing

Kafka Avro with Schema Registry

Securing Kafka (SSL, SASL, ACL)

Dead Letter Topics (DLTs)

Kafka in a microservices architecture

Event sourcing and CQRS using Kafka

# 📦 Phase 6: Production-Ready Setup
Monitoring with Kafka Manager, Prometheus, Grafana

Horizontal scalability with partitions and consumer groups

Distributed tracing with Sleuth/Zipkin

Deploying Kafka with Kubernetes
